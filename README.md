# The Baked Potato

## About

The Baked Potato is a twitterbot trained on "The Onion," a popular satirical news source. The Baked Potato reads tweets from The Onion and then generates its own original content similar to that tweeted by The Onion. This content consists of a funny headline often paired with a relevant image, which it finds using a dataset of annotated images.
